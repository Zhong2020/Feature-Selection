# Feature-Selection
This repository contains R code for various feature selection methods. The code is organized as outlined below.

* **Model Fits & GOF**: Includes functions for fitting the Cox, PO & YP models, as well as testing for goodness-of-fit.  For the Cox and PO cases, there are options for adjusting for age and stage, if desired. 
  * Required: R packages (survival, timereg, YPmodel)
  * Inputs: 
    * predictor, x (gene expression)
    * data frame with n rows (number of subjects) and columns with survival information (time = survival time, censor = censoring information) and p genes   
  * Output: model coefficient (beta), coefficient standard error, significance p-value, GOF p-value
  
* **Pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> Measures**: Includes functions for calculating each pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> measures (PO, CO, CH, ModCH and PH).  Note, each measure has a separate function.  In the future, we plan to combine the code into one R<sup>2</sup> function with option `type = c("PO", "CO", "CH", "ModCH", "PH")`. 
  * Required: R package (survival)
  * Inputs: 
    * predictor, x (gene expression)
    * survival time
    * censoring indicator
  * Output: R<sup>2</sup> measure
  
* **R<sup>2</sup><sub>LR</sub> & R<sup>2</sup><sub>I</sub> Measures**: This code contains functions for R<sup>2</sup><sub>LR</sub>, R<sup>2</sup><sub>I<sub>PO</sub></sub> & R<sup>2</sup><sub>I<sub>PH</sub></sub>. There are options for adjusting for age and stage, if desired.
  * Required: R packages (survival, timereg)
  * Inputs: 
    * predictor, x (gene expression)
    * survival time
    * censoring indicator
  * Output: R<sup>2</sup> measures
  
* **I Measures**: This code contains functions for I<sub>PO</sub> and I<sub>YP</sub>. There are options for adjusting for age and stage for I<sub>PO</sub>, if desired.
  * Required: R packages (survival, timereg, YPmodel)
  * This code assumes that your data is in the the following form:
    * Column 1 = survival time (time)
    * Column 2 = censoring indicator (censor)
    * Columns 3+ = genes
  * Output: 
    * I<sub>PO</sub>, outPO (I, I test statistic, I p-value)
    * I<sub>YP</sub>, outYP (I, I test statistic, I p-value)
  
* **Youden & AUC**: Computes Youden & AUC values based on gene ranking by a specified feature selection method
  * Required: R packages (MESS)
  * Inputs: 
    * data frame with n rows (number of genes) and 1 column (feature selection measure)
    * effectGenes: number of significant genes
  * Output option: Specificity, Sensitivity, Youden & AUC 

* **Simulations**: Contains R code for simulating data
  * Scheme 1: Univariate aproach; genes linked to survival one at a time
  * Scheme 2: Multivariate approach; incorporates correlation between features
  * For both schemes, there are options to simulate from the following models: LN, LL1, LL2, W1, W2
